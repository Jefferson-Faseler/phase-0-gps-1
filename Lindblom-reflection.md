What Git Concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS Session?

* Prior to the GPS I was struggling with to the point commit messages and merge conflicts. The merge conflicts especially because I had never run across one prior.

What Concepts were Clarified during the GPS?

* During the GPS the commit messages was touched on and how to make them professional and uniform. We both got a link from our guide that told about naming conventions.

What Questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

* A few of the questions that came to mind were why more than one person looked over an assignment and then differences in commands. The fetch command was new to mew and I learned more about it today along with what exactly origin meant.

What still confuses you about Git?

* Even after we worked out merge conflict enough to submit the file, we had trouble with getting the file to merge. By the time we fixed the conflict it was already late and we were still confused about how to fix it. I want to know more about how to fix merge conflict both on the local side and in gitHub.

How was your first experience of a pairing in a GPS?

* My first experience of a pairing in a GPS was good. It was interesting because I came into it not knowing how the whole pairing thing worked. It was nice to get a grasp on it. It was good to be able to ask questions about things too. As we worked through it our guide watched and when we were not being direct on something she would pitch in and explain why things happened when we asked. It really came down to what we made the session and it was great that both of us were active in discussion. After our guide left, my pair and I spent another hour and a half figuring out more about merge conflicts. I enjoyed being able to talk about something in depth with another who was just learning.
