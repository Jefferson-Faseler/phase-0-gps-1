##JJ Faseler reflections GPS 1.1
 * Some concepts I have been struggling with are good commit messages. I know they are supposed to be in present tense, and brief. But prior to the session I was especially struggling with what makes a good git commit message. 
 * When we were using our git workflow it was good to have our guide stop and say, "Hey, actually it is important to have a good commit message. And it is also good to get into the practice." our guide helped us find resources for learning good git workflow and what why a good git commit message is a good commit message. 
 * I asked my pair questions about clarification on some terms and concepts I didn't have a great grasp of up to that point. The questions I asked the guide were about how Dev Bootcamp would like for us to submit work and style work.
 * I am very confused about merge conflicts. We felt very lost and were having trouble replicating our problems. We switched roles to see if maybe we could attempt the marge conflict on a different computer but still had difficulty. I still don't know if we completed the merge conlfict successfully (we fixed it locally and pushed up the master branch, but GitHub did not recognize this.)
 * My first experience with a GPS was good, I wish we could have had guide help when we were at merge conflicts, but we were paired for over an hour at that point. My pair was excellent and so easy to get along with, we were there in the 'kitchen' together.
